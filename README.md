## The Problem

Most racing apps overwhelm you with data. Screens in the cockpit. Telemetry overload. Generic advice that doesn't understand physics.

**RacerTune removes it.**

No screens in corners. No pressure to push. Just an AI race engineer that speaks when it matters—and stays silent when it doesn't.

---

## What is RacerTune?

RacerTune is a **voice-only AI race engineer** designed exclusively for closed-track use. It delivers real-time coaching through precise, concise voice guidance—built on physics, not guesswork.

```
"Brake earlier next lap."
"Smooth steering."
"Good exit."
```

No chatter. No motivation talk. **Just facts.**

## Philosophy

<table>
<tr>
<td align="center" width="33%">

### 🛡️
**Safety First**

Physics is the ceiling. Advice never exceeds calculated grip limits.

</td>
<td align="center" width="33%">

### 🎯
**Accuracy Second**

When uncertain, RacerTune stays silent. Bad advice is worse than no advice.

<td align="center" width="33%">

### 💬
**Helpfulness Third**

Only when safe and accurate does coaching occur.

## How It Works

```
┌─────────────────┐      ┌─────────────────┐      ┌─────────────────┐
│     SENSORS     │      │  PHYSICS ENGINE │      │   VOICE OUTPUT  │

### Three Core Systems

| System | Function | How |
|--------|----------|-----|
| **Sensor Fusion** | Build the track | GPS + IMU automatically map the circuit |
| **Physics Envelopes** | Define the limits | Calculates controllable grip boundaries |
| **Adaptive Learning** | Improve accuracy | Gets smarter with each clean lap |

---

## The Voice

RacerTune communicates like an F1 race engineer:

| Type | Example | When |
|------|---------|------|
| **Instruction** | *"Brake earlier next lap."* | Before a corner you're overdriving |
| **Correction** | *"Trail brake into apex."* | Mid-corner technique adjustment |
| **Confirmation** | *"Good exit."* | When you nail it |
| **Reminder** | *"Smooth steering."* | Consistent technique cue |

**Calm. Precise. Only when necessary.**

---

## Safety Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| 🔒 **Physics is the ceiling** | Advice never exceeds calculated grip limits |
| 🛡️ **AI never decides safety** | The driver maintains full control, always |
| 🤫 **Silence over bad advice** | Uncertainty = quiet |
| 📱 **Offline, on-device** | No cloud dependency, no latency |
| 🏁 **Closed-track only** | Designed for controlled environments |

## ⚠️ Important Safety Notice

**RacerTune is designed exclusively for closed-track use:**

- Race circuits
- Karting tracks  
- Private test facilities
- Closed course events

**RacerTune must never be used on public roads.**

The system is a coaching aid, not a driving assistant. The driver is always fully responsible for vehicle control and safety decisions. RacerTune provides guidance only—it does not control the vehicle in any way.
